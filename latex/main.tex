  \begin{abstract}
		When working with large or complicated expressions, it can often be challenging to take the derivative by hand. We can compute a numerical approximation of the derivative at a certain point, but this loses the flexibility that an expression provides. This issue is solved in the real case by taking symbolic derivatives, which leave variables unsubstituted and produce a new expression representing the derivative. While similar techniques can be applied to take the derivative of complex functions, it is far more difficult because the derivative only exists where the expression is analytic. We consider a certain class of elementary functions and compositions of these functions. For any such expression, we give an algorithm that attempts to determine where the function is analytic and produces its symbolic derivative. We implement this algorithm and evaluate it over several examples, and compare it to existing methods of complex differentiation.
